## JAXB Introduction
- Java Architecture for XML Binding provides a fast and convenient way to bind XML schemas and Java representations, making it easy for Java developers to incorporate XML data and processing functions in Java applications. 
- JAXB provides methods for unmarshalling (reading) XML instance documents into Java content trees
- and marshalling (writing) Java context tree back into XML instance documents
## JAXB Architecture

A JAXB implementation consists of the following architectural components:
- Schema compiler: Binds a source schema to a set of schema-derived program elements. The binding is described by an XML-based binding language.
- Schema generator: Maps a set of existing program elements to a derived schema. The mapping is described by program annotations.
- Binding runtime framework: Provides unmarshalling and marshalling operations for accessing, manipulating, and validating XML content using either schema-derived or existing program elements.
## JAXB Binding Process

The general steps in the JAXB data binding process are:
1. Generate classes: An XML schema is used as input to the JAXB binding compiler to generate JAXB classes based on the schema.
2. Compile classes: All of the generated classes, source files, and application code must be compiled.
3. Unmarshal: XML documents written according to the constraints in the source schema are unmarshalled by the JAXB binding framework.
4. Generate content tree: the unmarshalling process generates a content tree of data objects instantiated from the generated JAXB classes; this content tree represents the structure and content of the source XML documents.
5. Validate (optional): The unmarshalling process involves validation of the source XML documents before generating the content tree. 
6. Process content: the client application can modify the XML data represented by the Java content tree by using interfaces generated by the binding compiler.
7. Marshal: the processed content tree is marshalled out to one or more XML output documents. The content may be validated before marshalling.
